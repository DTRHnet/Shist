# Vercel API Endpoints Fix

## Problem
The API endpoints in your Vercel deployment are not working because they were using mock data instead of connecting to the actual database.

## What I Fixed

### 1. Updated API Implementations
I've updated all the API implementations in the `api_impl/` directory to use the real database instead of mock data:

- `api_impl/lists.ts` - Now creates and retrieves real lists from the database
- `api_impl/connections.ts` - Now manages real user connections
- `api_impl/invitations.ts` - Now creates real invitations with proper tokens
- `api_impl/categories.ts` - Now retrieves real categories from the database
- `api_impl/lists/[id].ts` - Now handles real list operations (GET, PATCH, DELETE)
- `api_impl/lists/[id]/items.ts` - Now adds real items to lists

### 2. Added Default User Management
Since the API routes don't have authentication set up, I added a `ensureDefaultUser()` function that creates a default user if it doesn't exist. This ensures that all operations have a valid user to work with.

### 3. Added Better Error Handling
Added comprehensive error handling and database connection checks to help debug issues.

### 4. Created Test Endpoint
Added `/api/test-db` endpoint to test database connectivity and provide debugging information.

## Required Environment Variables

Make sure you have the following environment variable set in your Vercel deployment:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_connection_string
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Test Database Connection**: Visit `/api/test-db` to check if the database is properly configured
2. **Test List Creation**: Try creating a list via the UI or by making a POST request to `/api/lists`
3. **Test List Retrieval**: Try fetching lists via GET request to `/api/lists`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Database not configured" error
**Solution**: Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your Vercel project settings.

### Issue: "Failed to import storage module" error
**Solution**: This might be a build issue. Check that all dependencies are properly installed and the build process completes successfully.

### Issue: "Failed to initialize default user" error
**Solution**: This indicates a database connection issue. Check your `DATABASE_URL` and ensure the database is accessible.

## Next Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Add `DATABASE_URL` to your Vercel project settings
2. **Deploy**: Deploy the updated code to Vercel
3. **Test**: Use the `/api/test-db` endpoint to verify database connectivity
4. **Verify**: Test creating lists, connections, and invitations through the UI

## Authentication Note

The current implementation uses a default user for all operations. In a production environment, you should implement proper authentication to identify real users. The server-side routes in `server/routes.ts` already have authentication set up, but the Vercel API routes don't.

## Database Schema

The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following main tables:
- `users` - User accounts
- `lists` - User-created lists
- `list_items` - Items within lists
- `categories` - Categories for organizing items
- `connections` - User connections for sharing
- `invitations` - Invitations for connections and list sharing

Make sure your database has these tables created with the correct schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`.
